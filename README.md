What is Terraform?
* Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure
* This is done through configuration files to describe the components needed to run a single application or entire datacenter
* Terraform generates a plan -> then executes that plans to build the described infrastructure
* Terraform key features:
    * 1.) Infrastructure as Code - blueprint of your infrastructure using a high level configuration syntax
    * 2.) Execution Plans - what Terraform will do when you call apply
    * 3.) Resource Graph - Terraform builds a graph of all your resources
    * 4.) Change Automation - complex changes can be applied with minimal interaction and avoiding many possile human errors
